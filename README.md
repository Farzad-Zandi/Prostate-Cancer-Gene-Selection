## Abstract
<p align="justify">
Cancer remains a significant global health challenge, contributing to nearly 10 million deaths each year and imposing substantial burdens on individuals and healthcare systems worldwide. Thanks to the availability of analytical techniques, we can now generate thousands of data points using various OMICs techniques, such as proteomics, metabolomics, and genomics, for any given samples. However, dealing with such complex and multidimensional data introduces higher complexity, requiring the use of proper techniques to extract biologically relevant information. In this study, we employed three microarray datasets for Prostate, SRBCT, and Leukemia cancers, introducing a novel swarm intelligent technique to identify a precise and effective set of genetic markers. This approach aims to enhance diagnostic and prognostic accuracy while simplifying computational processes. Utilizing six common dimensionality reduction techniques and applying a Chaotic Crow Search feature selection with specific APfl parameters, we refined the top 10 genes using parallel computing. The combination of Fisher Score and Chaotic Crow Search yielded accuracy ranging from 92.63 to 96.23. Ultimately, this study successfully pinpointed a small set of genes, fewer than 10, with accuracy values spanning 90.83 to 96.23, potentially valuable for 3 very diverse cancers. The selected genes exhibit functional enrichment in biological processes (BP) related to lymphocyte differentiation, mononuclear cell differentiation, and B cell differentiation. In terms of cellular components (CC), the genes are associated with tertiary granule, secretory granule lumen, cytoplasmic vesicle lumen, and vesicle lumen. Additionally, the molecular functions (MF) of these genes include endopeptidase inhibitor activity, peptidase inhibitor activity, and endopeptidase regulator activity. This enriched gene profile suggests potential implications for cancer diagnosis, particularly in understanding the regulatory mechanisms and differentiation processes that may play crucial roles in cancer pathogenesis and progression.

## Description
Prostate dataset files are available in `.csv` and `.mat` format in Data folder.  
Feature selection methods for step 1 are available in Feature selection folder.  
Selected gene indexes with their accuracy that produced as `.csv` files are available in GeneIndex_and_Accuracy_CSV_Outputs folder.
## Usage
To run the model, follow the steps below:  
1. Running `Main_crow_search.m` file will done all steps automatically.  
   - For 10 iteration:
   - For each feature selection method (1 to 6).
   - For each chaotic vectors (1 to 10) in addition to const0.5 and random numbers.
   - For 1 to max Iteration.
   - For APfl methods.
   - Generate matlab outputs as `.mat` files. As a results for each chaotic, 54 .mat file will be generate.
